# GZTrafficState
The state of Guangzhou traffic. 广州交通现状图示。

![This is an image which describes the harsh reality of traffic in Guangzhou. People cannot get on or off the bus easily because electric bicycles are driving past quickly in the lane "for bicycles" between the bus lane and sidewalk.](gztrafficstate.jpg "The state of Guangzhou traffic illustrated by an image made using Microsoft PowerPoint.")

The state of Guangzhou traffic illustrated by an image made using Microsoft PowerPoint.

# Why? 为什么要做这张图？

Right now all I can say is that it's directly inspired by a [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JX4y1H7Au) and my personal experiences walking on the streets.

目前我能说的就是我创作这张图片是受到了[这部影片](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JX4y1H7Au)以及本人在路上行走经历的启发。仅作现状描述，无意表达任何个人见解。
